## How do you communicate between microservices in Spring Boot?

- **RESTful APIs**: Using HTTP requests and responses to exchange data between microservices.
- **Spring Cloud**: Utilizing components like Eureka for service discovery, Ribbon for client-side load balancing, and Feign for declarative REST clients.
- **Message Brokers**: Using tools like RabbitMQ or Kafka for asynchronous communication via message queues.
- **API Gateways**: Routing and load balancing requests across multiple microservices using tools like Spring Cloud Gateway or Netflix Zuul.
- **Service-to-Service Calls**: Direct HTTP or RPC calls between microservices, often managed by Spring Cloud components.
