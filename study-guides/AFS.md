## Describe the concepts of Java object-oriented programming?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based
on the concept of "objects"

### Classes and Objects:
- the blueprint or template for creating objects.
- defines the attributes and methods that all objects of that type will have.
- an object is an instance of a class.
- It represents a specific entity in the program's domain.

### Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and
methods that operate on that data into a single unit (a class).

- Hides the internal state of an object
- Only exposes the necessary operations to interact with it
- Promotes data abstraction and security.

### Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism by which one class can inherit properties and behavior from another class.

- The class being inherited from is called the `superclass` or `parent` class,
- The class that inherits is called the `subclass` or `child` class.
- Promotes code reuse
- Allows for the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

### Polymorphism:
Polymorphism means the ability to take many forms.
Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

#### Two types of polymorphism:
- compile-time polymorphism (method overloading)
- runtime polymorphism (method overriding).

Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

### Abstraction:
Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

Abstract classes and interfaces are key components of abstraction in Java.

- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated
- May contain abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.
- Interfaces define a contract for classes to implement,
- Interfaces specify a set of methods that must be defined by any class that implements the interface.
