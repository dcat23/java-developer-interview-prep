## Tell me about yourself
I am Devin Catuns, a Full Stack Java Developer with four years of experience in 
software development. 

I specialize in building applications using:
   - Core Java,
   - Spring Boot,
   - React,
   - various database systems such as Postgres.

I began my journey with an Associate degree in Electical Engineering from Amarillo College
and further honed my skills in software engineering through a rigorous cohort 
at App Academy. 

My professional experience includes developing and maintaining complex 
systems for financial institutions:
- loan approval and payment systems at Kearny Bank
- mortgage loan processing applications at JG Wentworth

In my most recent role at Kearny Bank, I actively participated in all
phases of the software development life cycle, from design to deployment.

- Developed web services using Spring Boot, 
- Created JSON structures for data transfer, 
- implemented Hibernate for ORM, 
- integrated CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions.

I am passionate about solving challenging problems and continuously 
improving my skills. 

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working closely 
with business stakeholders to deliver high-quality, impactful solutions. 

In addition to my technical expertise, I bring strong communication and 
problem-solving skills to the table, which I believe are crucial for 
successful software development.

I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to the Prime Delivery 
Experience at Amazon and look forward to discussing how my background 
and skills align with this role.

## Brief us about your exp and tech stacks currently using or used in the recent project?

      I've been working on an automated multi-application system for

Prior to Kearny Bank, I worked as a Full Stack Java Developer at
Kethamsoft, where I developed an airline ticketing application 
using Agile methodologies. 

This involved creating interactive web pages with XML and JSON-based 
translations, working on RESTful APIs with Node.js, and managing 
version control with Git and JIRA for defect tracking.

Overall, my experience has equipped me with a robust understanding
of full-stack development, and I'm proficient in both frontend and 
backend technologies.

I'm excited about the prospect of applying these skills to enhance 
the Prime Delivery Experience at Amazon.

## Describe the flow of your loan approval project at Kearny Bank?

Certainly! Let me walk you through the flow of the Loan Approval and Payment System project I worked on at Kearny Bank.

1. **Loan Application Submission**
    - **Customer Interaction**
        - fill out loan applications online
        - personal information, income details, loan amount, and purpose of loan
    - **Document Upload**:
        - through the online portal
        - proof of income, identity verification

2. **Initial Processing and Validation**

    - **Data Validation**:
        - The system validates data for completeness and correctness.
    - **Credit Check**:
        - An automated credit check
        - performed using third-party services
        - assess the customer's creditworthiness

3.  **Loan Authorization**

    - **Review by Loan Officers**: Loan officers review the application and credit check results. They may request additional information or documentation from the customer.
    - **Decision Making**: Based on the review, loan officers either approve or reject the loan application. This decision is logged in the system.

4. **Audit Trails**

    - Tracking Changes:
        - Every change and action taken during the loan approval process is logged for audit purposes. This ensures transparency and accountability.
    - Compliance Checks: The system performs compliance checks to ensure all regulatory requirements are met during the loan processing.

5. Payment Setup

    - Payment Scheduling: Upon loan approval, customers can set up one-time or recurring payments. They select payment dates, amounts, and payment methods.
    - Payment Confirmation: The system confirms the payment schedule and sends a confirmation to the customer.

6. Loan Disbursement

    - Funds Transfer: Once all conditions are met, the loan amount is disbursed to the customer's bank account.
    - Notification: The customer receives a notification about the disbursement along with a repayment schedule.

7. Repayment Management

    - Payment Processing: The system automatically processes scheduled payments, deducting amounts from the customer's bank account.
    - Reminders: Customers receive reminders about upcoming payments via email or SMS.
    - Payment Tracking: The system tracks all payments, updating the loan balance and payment history.

## My Role and Responsibilities
      Backend Development

### Web Services:
      I developed JAX-WS web services to handle various operations, such as application submission, 
      loan approval, and payment processing.
### DAO Implementation:
      I created DAO (Data Access Object) classes using Hibernate to interact with the database. 
      This involved writing configuration files and queries to manage data.
### Batch Jobs:
      Developed and implemented batch jobs using Spring Batch for tasks like 
      scheduled payment processing and data validation.
### Frontend Development

- JSON Data Structure: Developed the JSON structure for data transfer between the Google Web Toolkit (UI) and the business tier.
- UI Integration: Integrated the frontend with backend services, ensuring smooth data flow and user interactions.

### Service Integration

      Enterprise Service Bus (ESB): Implemented ESB as a gateway between the business tier and UI, ensuring separation of concerns and modularity.
- Third-Party Services: Integrated with third-party services for credit checks, document verification, and payment processing.
### Testing and Deployment

- Unit Testing: Developed unit test cases using JUnit to ensure the reliability and functionality of the code.
- Performance Testing: Used JTest Tool for performance testing, ensuring the system could handle high loads and function efficiently.
- Continuous Integration: Used Hudson for continuous integration, automating the build and deployment process.

### Collaboration and Agile Practices

- Agile Methodology: Participated in Agile ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to ensure smooth project progress.
- Team Collaboration: Worked closely with loan officers, business analysts, and QA teams to gather requirements, develop solutions, and ensure quality.

## How It Works

### Frontend:
      Customers interact with the system through an intuitive web
      interface, submitting applications and managing payments.
### Backend:
      The backend services, developed using Spring Boot and Hibernate,
      handle business logic, data processing, and service integration.
### Database:
      All data is stored in a relational database, with Hibernate
      managing the ORM layer.
### Web Services:
      Spring Boot web services facilitate communication between 
      different system components and external services.
### Testing and CI/CD:
      Rigorous testing ensures code quality, while continuous 
      integration automates build and deployment, enabling frequent and reliable releases.

Overall, my role in this project was to
- ensure the backend services were robust, efficient, and seamlessly integrated with the frontend and third-party services
- providing a smooth and reliable experience for both customers and loan officers.
